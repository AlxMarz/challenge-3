## Description  

- The purpose of this app was to create a password generator with the amount of characters and the selected criteria the user select to create a password. 
- A strong password is something that not many people will think of that makes it harder for someone to take and log into a persons account and cause damage.
- The password generator was able to create a strong password based off what the user wanted.
- This project in JS really tested my knowledge and faced by biggest fear which is functions and conditional statements but i also learned about alerts, prompt, math.random and much more.
